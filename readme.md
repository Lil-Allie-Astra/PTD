PyTube Video Downloader

Setup:
1. Extract into "C:\Users\Public\Documents\PTD".
2. Copy "PTD.lnk" (shortcut) and paste wherever is convenient for you; personally, I prefer to "Pin to Taskbar" on the "PTD.lnk".

Usage:
1. Copy the YouTube URL of a video to be downloaded.
2. Run the program with the shortcut or the .exe in "/scrits" directly.
3. It will download the video to "C:\Users\Public\Videos" as a MKV Video format.

	Note: if you add ".LNK;" to the end of the Environment Variable "PATHEXT" and then paste the shortcut into a directory in "PATH", you can run this from from any console or from the Run dialog by entering PTD.
